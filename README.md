# Getting Started with mavros

## Goal
Setting up a ROS System with a mavros bridge so that a pixhawk flight controller (FCU) can be connected to a companion computer with a ROS running.

---
## Setting up Linux computer
The following steps have to be completed for setting up a mavros connection with a pixhawk. First of all you need to install ***ROS***. A installation guide can be found [here](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu)

For installing ***mavros*** it is recommended to use the source installation as described [here](https://dev.px4.io/en/ros/mavros_installation.html)

### catkin workspace
If you already have a catkin workspace you can skip these section.
If not you can create one as follows:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws_mavros/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws_mavros
$ catkin init
```
### Install ROS python tools
If you already have `python-wstool`, `python-rosinstall-generator` and ` python-catkin-tools` installed during the ROS installation you can skip these section. Otherwise you can also install them with:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python-wstool python-rosinstall-generator python-catkin-tools
```

### Install mavros package
If you have `ROS`, a directory for `catkin_ws` and `python-wstool`, `python-rosinstall-generator` and ` python-catkin-tools` installed you are ready to install the mavros bridge.

** 1. Getting the source: **

```bash
$ rosinstall_generator --upstream mavros | tee /tmp/mavros.rosinstall
```

** 2. Getting the latest Mavlink package**
```
$ rosinstall_generator mavlink | tee -a /tmp/mavros.rosinstall
```

** 3. Setup workspace & install deps**
```bash
$ wstool merge -t src /tmp/mavros.rosinstall
$ wstool update -t src
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro `echo $ROS_DISTRO` -y
```

** 4. Build the mavros package**
```bash
$ catkin build
```

### Install Network Time Protocol Deamon (ntpd)
You have to install the `ntp` for synchronize time across computers with NTP servers.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ntp  
```

An other solution is [Chrony](https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/).

## Setting up the pixhawk

### Telem2 as companion
First of all you have to activate a MAVLink stream on the Telem2 port with data streams specific to onboard mode. This can be achieved by setting the baud rate of the parameter `SYS_COMPANION = 921600`(recommended) or `SYS_COMPANION = 57600`. The easiest way for doing so is by connecting the pixhawk to QGroundControl (QGC) an navigate to the Paramterlist.


### Changing Stream Rate
At a baud rate of 921600 is the default mavlink stream rate as follows.

**TODO: List of the frequencies**

To change the stream rate of a specific MAVLink [Message](http://mavlink.org/messages/) you have two options.

**Option 1: Configuration with SD-Card (recommended for first setup)**
When booting the px4 Firmware loads some settings from the SD-Card. For configure the stream rate you have to add file `extras.txt` to the directory `/etc/` on the SD-Card and add the following lines.

```bash
mavlink stream -u <port number> -s <mavlink topic name> -r <rate>
```
- A list of `<mavlink topic name>` can be found [here](http://mavlink.org/messages/common/#HEARTBEAT) (*IMU:* `HIGHRES_IMU`)
- A list of `<port number>` can be found [here](). (*Telem2:* `/dev/ttyS2`, *USB:* `/dev/ttyACM0`)

**Example IMU:** For sending the high resolution IMU ([HIGHRES_IMU](http://mavlink.org/messages/common#HIGHRES_IMU))sensor data form the pixhawk Telem2 port at a stream rate of 120Hz you have to add the following line to the file `/etc/extras.txt` on the SD-Card.
```
 mavlink stream -d /dev/ttyS2 -s HIGHRES_IMU -r 120
```

---

## Usage
This section describes the usage of mavros in an example for getting the imu data of the pixhawk by sendig the Mavlink Stream over Telem 2 Port to an FTDI Converte to a USB socket on a linux computer.

### Find connected USB port
```bash
$ ls /dev/ttyUSB*
```

### start the ros Master
```bash
$ roscore
```
### Start the mvavros node:
```bash
$ roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:=serial:///dev/ttyUSB0:921600
```
### Get SensorData from pixhawk
For getting the data form pixhawk you can type the following line into your ros console.
```bash
$ rostopic echo </topic_name>
```
A list of the available topic_name can be found by the command `rostopic list`

**Example IMU:**
```bash
$ rostopic echo /mavros/imu/data/raw
```
To check the stream rate use following command:
```bash
$ rostopic hz /mavros/imu/data/raw
```
raw for getting the higher_imu


---
## Usefull mavros commands
### Get SensorData of the pixhawk imu
```bash
$ rostopic echo /mavros/imu/data
```
### Getting paramters from pixhawk
```bash
$ rosrun mavros mavparam get SYS_COMPANION
```
### Chanching mode
```bash
$ rosrun mavros mavsys mode -c STABILIZED
```
### Arming
```bash
$ rosrun mavros mavsafety arm
```
### Comand To Start
```bash
$ rosrun mavros mavcmd takeoffcur -a 0 0 10
 ```

 ```bash
  help:
   description: Takeoff at current position.

   usage: mavcmd takeoffcur [-h] [-a] min_pitch yaw altitude

   positional arguments:
     min_pitch      Min pitch
     yaw            Desired Yaw
     altitude       Altitude

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help     show this help message and exit
     -a, --any-gps  Try to find GPS topic (warn: could be dangerous!)
  ```

### Set Waypoint
```bash
$ rosrun mavros mavsetp local -p 1 0 0 0
```

# Firmware auf pixhawk flashen

for the Pixhawk j

## Build
```bash
make px4fmu-v3_default upload
```

## Upload
Append upload to the make commands to upload the compiled binary to the autopilot hardware via USB. For example

```bash
make px4fmu-v3_default upload
```


A succesfull upload will be confirmed by....
```bash
Erase  : [====================] 100.0%
Program: [====================] 100.0%
Verify : [====================] 100.0%
Rebooting.

[100%] Built target upload
```

If ther are Problems with the bootloader. reconnect usb connection to the pixhawk.
